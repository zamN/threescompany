Repo for Daemon Dash Hackathon

Hello team! Welcome to the Daemon Dash Hackathon 2013 at the UMD! 
If you find that you have any questions during the course of the hackathon, please email 
bkadams@cs.umd.edu, srenehan@cs.umd.edu or tweet us at @umdcompsci #daemondash

We suggest that you save your code frequently, and make sure that you have copies elsewhere. Weâ€™d love for you to push code here frequently, but we understand that you may want to keep your code private. 

You must submit your code to your repository by 12:30pm EST.

Keep in mind the criteria by which you will be judged: 

There is a maximum of 10 points for the categories for a maximum total score of 50 points.  

    Technical sophistication (how interesting/challenging is your project?)
    Originality (Innovation and creativity is absolutely necessary)
    Practicality (How does this project help the larger community?)
    Aesthetics (How appealing is the user interface? How much have you considered design elements? )
    Rockstar potential. (Will this project make crowds of people want to use your product?)

We will post the order of the presentations (chosen randomly) on Twitter at noon on Sunday.  Make sure you pay close attention to the order! You will have 2 minutes to present in front of the judges in 1115. 

The judges are as follows:

<b>Elaine Shi (Assistant Professor of Computer Science) 

<b>Neil Spring (Associate Professor of Computer Science)

<b>Vassilos Lekakis (Senior PhD Student, Computer Science)
